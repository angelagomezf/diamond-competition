# Predincting Diamond Prices
## Ironhack's Data Analytics Bootcamp Project nยบ VI: Diamond Kaggle Competition
---
The **main goal** of this project is to predict the price of diamonds based on what we have learned in class the previous week about Supervised Machine Learning techniques.

### About the project
In this project we have to participate in a Kaggle competition where the model that best predicts diamonds prices (the model that has the lowest RMSE) is the one who wins.

**Diamond characteristics**:
- id
- price
- carat
- cut
- color
- clarity
- x
- y
- z
- depth
- table

### Data
The data has been source from a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diamonds-datamad1020/data) database.

### Steps
1. Data preparation, feature selection and extraction
2. Train-test split the data

# Predincting Diamond Prices
## Ironhack's Data Analytics Bootcamp Project nÂº VI: Diamond Kaggle Competition

---
The **main goal** of this project is to predict the price of diamonds based on what we have learned in class the previous week about Supervised Machine Learning techniques.

## About the project
In this project we have to participate in a Kaggle competition where the model that best predicts diamonds prices (the model that has the lowest RMSE) is the one who wins.

**Diamond characteristics**:
- id
- price
- carat
- cut
- color
- clarity
- x
- y
- z
- depth
- table

## Data
The data has been source from a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diamonds-datamad1020/data) database.


## Steps
1. First, we explore the dataset in order to understand the data. We prepare it, select features and extract those we are most interest in
    - Explore
    - Convert categorical data (cut, color, clarity) to numerical by creating my own dictionary with the values I have considered are more/less important.

2. Second, we test different regression Machine Learning algorithms to see which one returns a lower RMSE.
    - Model 1: Linear Regression
    - Model 2:
    - Model 3: 

    To do so, we train-test split the data with the train dataset. Once we are happy with the result, we test the model with the prediction dataset.

3. Thrid and final step, we submit the different tested models into Kaggle to check which one has a lower RMSE and highest score among the competitors.
